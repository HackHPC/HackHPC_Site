		<h3>Science Gateway Community Institute</h3>
		<p>The NSF funded Science Gateway Community Institute (SGCI), connects people and resources to accelerate discovery by empowering the science gateway community.  SGCI provides services, resources, community support, and education for creating and sustaining science gateways. Science Gateways are online interfaces that give researchers, educators, and students easy access to specialized, shared resources that are specific to a science or engineering discipline. Nurturing the next generation of gateway users and developers is a critical part of the SGCI effort. Our student-focused programs run by Workforce Development offers students access to the mentoring, career development,  internships and workshops that students need for pursuing a career building or using science gateways.   SGCI is co-sponsoring this Hackathon to challenge up-and-coming programmers for tomorrow's science gateways.</p>
