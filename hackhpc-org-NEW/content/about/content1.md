    <center><h5>Je'aime Powell</h5></center>
    <br>
    <center>Hello my name is Je’aime.  I am a Systems Administrator and a researcher on high performance computers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. My first computer was a Commedore64 and I have been fortunate to work in the field since I was a sophomore in high school.  Currently, I work closely with scientists to design and build remote environmental sensors that send data directly into science gateways for use in analysis and modelling varied natural processes.  On the weekend you can often find me volunteering or in the woods camping.
