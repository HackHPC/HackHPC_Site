  <center><h5><a href="/mentors">MENTORS</a></h5></center>

<center>Mentors lead students in the design and development of a response to a question over the course of the event. This includes a set of deliverables (GitHub repository, with any associated code and a PDF of a team presentation) and a final presentation given to the group. The hackathon will schedule daily check-in’s during which brief updates will need to be given.  Prior to the event, Mentors should allow approximately two hours of prep and overview time to generate a question/project which the participants could select to address as well as time for two brief conference calls with other mentors, supporting staff, participants and the organizing committee.During the event it is suggested that a minimum of four hours daily be allotted to assisting the group. Communication is vital to the success of any team and hackathons (especially in a virtual format) need dedicated time to ensure team success.</center>

<center><h5><a href="/support">SUPPORTING STAFF</a></h5></center>

<center>Supporting Staff are generally persons that may not have a project, but they do have domain knowledge and/or skills which they can make available to the teams for project support. They  are resources both mentors and participants utilize to bounce ideas and  find unique solutions to “sticking points” over the course of the event. Prior to the event, Supporting Staff should allow approximately one hour of time for two brief conference calls with other mentors, supporting staff, participants and the organizing committee to give an overview of the event schedule, as well as answer any resource or logistical concerns. During the event it is suggested that a minimum of two to three hours be allotted daily for assisting the various groups.</center>

  <center><h5><a href="/hackers">PARTICIPANTS</a></h5></center>

<center>Participants are generally students from secondary educational institutions that have varied skill sets and a willingness to tackle the questions and/or projects posed by the mentors. The participants are the reasons the hackathons exist and produce solutions to many pressing issues. Skill levels can vary from zero to expert which allows opportunities to collaborate and grow through the hackathon experience. Prior to the event, Participants should allow approximately one hour of time for a brief conference call with other mentors, supporting staff, participants and the organizing committee. During the event it is suggested that a minimum of four to six hours be allotted daily for dedicated work on the selected project. The hackathon will schedule daily check-in’s  for the groups in which brief updates of work and goals will need to be given. The last day of the event will include a team given presentation as well as submission of deliverables (GitHub repository, with any associated code and a PDF of a team presentation).</center>
